Choosing the right TV depends on room size, resolution, and usage.

Measure viewing distance. For 6–8 feet, 43-inch is ideal.

2. Resolution:
Full HD is good, but 4K gives sharper details.

3. Sound:
Look for Dolby Audio or DTS support.

4. Ports:
Ensure HDMI & USB ports for connectivity.

Invest wisely based on your usage: gaming, movies, or daily TV shows.
